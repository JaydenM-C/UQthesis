# UQthesis
### R Markdown template for UQ theses

This package provides an R Markdown template for UQ theses. It is built underlyingly off the UQ Graduate School's LaTeX template, modified for Pandoc conversion. This template is built to work with Yui Xie's Bookdown package, which is a natural fit for a document such as a thesis. The idea is that you will produce an R Markdown file for each chapter and then Bookdown concatenates these together to produce a complete thesis.
